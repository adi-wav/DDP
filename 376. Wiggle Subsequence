Problem:
A wiggle sequence is a sequence where the differences between successive numbers strictly alternate between positive and negative. The first difference (if one exists) may be either positive or negative. A sequence with one element and a sequence with two non-equal elements are trivially wiggle sequences.

For example, [1, 7, 4, 9, 2, 5] is a wiggle sequence because the differences (6, -3, 5, -7, 3) alternate between positive and negative.
In contrast, [1, 4, 7, 2, 5] and [1, 7, 4, 5, 5] are not wiggle sequences. The first is not because its first two differences are positive, and the second is not because its last difference is zero.
A subsequence is obtained by deleting some elements (possibly zero) from the original sequence, leaving the remaining elements in their original order.

Given an integer array nums, return the length of the longest wiggle subsequence of nums.

Code:
class Solution {
public:
    int wiggleMaxLength(vector<int>& nums) {
        int n=nums.size();
        vector<int> up(n,0), down(n,0);
        up[0]=1, down[0]=1;
        for(int i=1;i<n;i++){
            if(nums[i]>nums[i-1]){
                up[i]=down[i-1]+1;
                down[i]=down[i-1];
            }
            else if(nums[i]<nums[i-1]){
                down[i]=up[i-1]+1;
                up[i]=up[i-1];
            }
            else{
                up[i]=up[i-1];
                down[i]=down[i-1];
            }
        }
        return max(up[n-1],down[n-1]);
    }
};

Thought process:
sbse pehle to isme vo approach try ki thi ki har element se pura array traverse krenge aur jb jb alternate diff ayega count++ krenge but vo kaam nhi kia. to fir ye dusri approach h jisme bahut awesome tarike se dp use kia gya h. mtlb dp kya hota h apne prev result ko use krke present vale ki value nikalna to isme bhi bs vhi kia h. sbse pehle do array leli up aur down aur dono ke 0 index ko 1 se initialise krdia. aur fir i=1 se iterate krna shuru kia aur agar nums[i[]-nums[i-1] +ve h to up[i] ko value di h usse pichle down vale ko increment krke kyuki hme alternate vala chahiye na isliye positive diff h to negative vale me add kia h 1 ese hi jb diff -ve ayega to uske corresponding krenge. aur jb diff 0 hoga tb ditto pichle value daldenge mtlb no increment in length. aur fir last me max of up[n-1], down[n-1] lelenge kyuki pehle diff +ve -ve kuch bhi ho skta h.
